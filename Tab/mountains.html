                        When tectonic plates move about, volcanoes are formed, and when volcanoes erupt, 
                        mountains are formed in turn. The famous volcanic mountains are 
                        stratovolcanoes or shield volcanoes. A shield volcano has a gently sloping cone. The composite 
                        volcano or stratovolcano has a more steeply rising cone (33°-40°).

                    <p>Fold Mountains<br><br>
                        Fold mountains are created where two or more of Earth’s tectonic plates are pushed 
                        together. At these colliding, compressing boundaries, rocks and debris are warped 
                        and folded into rocky outcrops, hills, mountains, and entire mountain ranges.

                    <p>Block Mountains<br><br>
                        The raising of a fault block leads to the formation of block mountains. Higher 
                        blocks are called horsts and troughs are known as grabens. When the surface is 
                        spread apart, it leads tensional forces coming into place when these tension forces 
                        split apart; it causes the centre block to drop down. An example of this is the 
                        Sierra Nevada Range in the United States.

                    <p>Residual Mountains<br><br>
                        Through an erosion of an elevated area residual mountains are formed. Alternatively 
                        such formations are also known as mountains of denudation. The Scottish Highlands, 
                        Scandanavian Mountains, and the landmass of the Balkan Peninsula are examples of 
                        Residual Mountains.

                    <p>Dome Mountains<br><br>
                        Dome mountains are formed when large globs of magma float up from beneath the 
                        crust and push up surface rocks, creating a rounded swelling in the crust. Once 
                        the magma cools, it creates a large dome of harder rock under the surface, which 
                        erosion sometimes reveals.

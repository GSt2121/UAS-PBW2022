                        Igneous rocks (derived from the Latin word for fire) are formed when molten hot 
                        material cools and solidifies. Igneous rocks can also be made a couple of 
                        different ways. When they are formed inside of the earth, they are called 
                        intrusive, or plutonic, igneous rocks. If they are formed outside or on top 
                        of Earthâ€™s crust, they are called extrusive, or volcanic, igneous rocks.

                    <p>Metamorphic Rocks<br><br>
                        Metamorphic rocks are rocks that have been changed from their original form 
                        by immense heat or pressure. Metamorphic rocks have two classes: foliated 
                        and nonfoliated. When a rock with flat or elongated minerals is put under 
                        immense pressure, the minerals line up in layers, creating foliation.

                    <p>Sedimentary Rock<br><br>
                        Sedimentary rocks are formed from pieces of other existing rock or organic material. 
                        There are three different types of sedimentary rocks: clastic, organic (biological), and chemical. 
                        Clastic sedimentary rocks, like sandstone, form from clasts, or pieces of other rock. 
                        Organic sedimentary rocks, like coal, form from hard, biological materials like plants, shells, 
                        and bones that are compressed into rock.

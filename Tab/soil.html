                    <p>Sandy Soil<br><br>
                        Sandy soils are one of the poorest types of soil for growing plants because it has 
                        very low nutrients and poor water holding capacity, which makes it hard for the 
                        plantâ€™s roots to absorb water. This type of soil is very good for the drainage 
                        system. Sandy soil is usually formed by the breakdown or fragmentation of rocks 
                        like granite, limestone and quartz.

                    <p>Silt Soil<br><br>
                        Silt have much smaller particles compared to sandy soil and made up of rock and 
                        other mineral particles, which are smaller than sand and larger than clay. It is 
                        the smooth and fine quality of the soil that holds water better than sand.  Silt 
                        is easily transported by moving currents and it is mainly found near the river, 
                        lakes and other water bodies. The silt soil is more fertile compared to the other 
                        three types of soil.

                    <p>Clay Soil<br><br>
                        Clay is the smallest particle among the other two types of soil. The particles in 
                        this soil are tightly packed together with each other with very little or no 
                        airspace. This soil has very good water storage qualities and makes it hard for 
                        moisture and air to penetrate into it. It is very sticky to the touch when wet but 
                        smooth when dried.  Clay is the densest and heaviest type of soil which does not 
                        drain well or provide space for plant roots to flourish.

                        It is a combination of sand, silt and clay such that the beneficial properties of 
                        each are included. For instance, it has the ability to retain moisture and 
                        nutrients; hence, it is more suitable for farming. This soil is also referred to 
                        as agricultural soil as it includes an equilibrium of all three types of soil 
                        materials, being sandy, clay, and silt, and it also happens to have humus. Apart 
                        from these, it also has higher calcium and pH levels because of its inorganic origins.

                    <p>Plateaus<br><br>
                        table land that is high with a flat top. It has steep slopes. Many rivers 
                        flow through plaÂ­teaus. Some plateaus are large like The Deccan Plateaus in 
                        India and the highest one is in Tibet. Other examples are Colorado in 
                        N. America and Bolivian plateau in S. America. The dry side of the plateaus 
                        is sheltered from the winds and does not get rains, climate is cold.

                    <p>Plains<br><br>
                        low lying and flat lands are called plains, can be hilly sometimes. Rivers 
                        deposit sand and silt to form plains. Some of them are in the interior of the 
                        continent and some near the sea coast. They are thickly populated with large 
                        cities and towns. Roads and railways are easier to build in plains. Fertile 
                        soil is suitable for agriculture. Ancient civilization came up on the banks 
                        of rivers, on the plains.

                    <p>Mountains<br><br>
                        The mighty chunks rise all over the world, including the oceans. They usually 
                        have steep, sloping sides and sharp or rounded ridges, and a high point, 
                        called a peak or summit. Most geologists classify a mountain as a landform 
                        that rises at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) or more above its surrounding area.

                    <p>Hills<br><br>
                        piece of land that rises higher than everything surrounding it. It looks like a 
                        little bump in the Earth. Since theyre higher than everything around them, 
                        hills are good places to get a nice view.
